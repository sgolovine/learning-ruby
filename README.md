# learning-ruby

I don't know all that much ruby (specifically rails). Lets change that.

## What is this?

This is a useless API that I created specifically for learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Please do not use this as any sort of example, there are probably lots of things I did incorrectly here. Also and this should go without saying, please don't try to use this in production.

## The plan

The plan is to create an API that consumes the HackerNews API and then spits out result formatted in some way (did I mention this thing was useless?). From there attach all the necessary things that a production API will require in the real world, linting, tests, etc.


## Setup

1. Install RVM ([link](https://rvm.io)) 


## Build Log 

Just a little log of my journey


**Monday April 13, 2020**: The setup. So far everything is going smoothly. Had to make a decision right off the bat whether I wanted to use a regular installation or Ruby, RVM or RBENV. Decided to go with RVM for the time being though I don't think that has a bearing on future work and can be swapped out easily. Reading up on how .rvmrc and .ruby_version configuration files work. Seemed like rvmrc was the way to go but after reading about some of the limitations, using .ruby_version should suffice.
