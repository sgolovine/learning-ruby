# learning-ruby

I don't know all that much ruby (specicially rails). Lets change that.

## What is this?

This is a useless API that I created specifically for learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Please do not use this as any sort of example, there are probably lots of things I did incorrectly here.



## The plan

The plan is to create an API that consumes the HackerNews API and then spits out result formatted in some way (did I mention this thing was useless?). From there attach all the necissary things that a production API will require in the real world, linting, tests, etc.
